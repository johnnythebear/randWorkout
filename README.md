# randWorkout
Generate random workout

You can generate a random workout by adding exercises and rep ranges. First you have to input the exercise names, then the minimum and maximum rep numbers. On the basis of the input parameters the program will generate a card deck, where each card is an exercise with a rep number. With pressing ENTER, you can pull a card from the deck.
